<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool that supports Instant Impact globally by providing a platform to share knowledge and experience with our various technologies. This easy-to-read format makes tools easier to discover and helps us evaluate technologies thoroughly. This project is based on the Zalando/tech-radar.

The Instant Impact Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called ring assignment. We categorise technologies into four rings, defined as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also on a large scale. Typically technology that has a high adoption rate across our clients and internally.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we are trialling to solve an existing challenge; once the benefits are confirmed and limitations are understood we would move to ADOPT. We typically move to TRIAL once we have ASSESSEDs.</li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth investing some research and investigation into to see if it has the desired impact. ASSESS technologies are new to us and are highly unproven in our organisation.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for our clients and internally at Instant Impact. Technologies that we have decided not to renew contractually or are not (yet for us) solving a specifically challenge or other reasons. It is our recommendation that HOLD technologies should not be used unless for specific projects and discussion with the Transformation Team.</li>
</ul>

</p>
We categorise the technologies into the following four quadrants: 
</p>

 <ul>
<li><strong>RECRUITMENT TECHNOLOGIES</strong> &mdash; Technologies designed to perform specific recruitment-related tasks or solve recruitment challenges for our clients or internal teams.</li>
<li><strong>OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES</strong> &mdash; Technologies designed to enhance operational efficiency for our clients or internal teams (specifically within the P&C and Transformation functions).</li>
<li><strong>GROWTH TECHNOLOGIES</strong> &mdash; Technologies designed to enhance operational efficiency within the Growth function.</li>
<li><strong>FRAMEWORKS & TECHNIQUES</strong> &mdash; Established frameworks or techniques adopted by our business to enhance efficiency. These follow best practices and drive improvements in key areas.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is used to visualise the technologies in use, trial, assessment, and on hold across Instant Impact, and to support the Transformation Team in choosing the best technologies to use when supporting new projects or solving any business/recruitment problems. It allows the business to share its knowledge and experience with a wide range of technology, to reflect on technology decisions, and continuously evolve our technology landscape.</p>

<h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Chief Transformation Officer</em> and <em>Product Manager</em> — who facilitate and drive the technology selection discussions at Instant Impact. Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. All Instant Impact employees can contribute to the Tech Radar. Active participation is highly encouraged and is important to help evaluate the effectiveness of using the tools, to share lessons learned, and to build out best practice for using the technologies.</p>
</p>

<p>
In addition to the Tech Radar, we actively collaborate with existing tech partners to enhance their product offerings for our clients and internal teams. To see Instant Impact's roadmap, click here (TBC).
