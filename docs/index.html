<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool that supports Instant Impact's Transformation Team globally by providing a platform to share knowledge and experience with our various technologies. This easy-to-read format makes tools easier to discover and helps us evaluate technologies thoroughly. This project is based on the [Zalando/tech-radar](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar).

The Instant Impact Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called *ring assignment*. We categorise technologies into four rings, defined as follows:
We categorise the technologies into the following four quadrants: 

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also on a large scale. Typically technology that has a high adoption rate across our clients and internally.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we are trialling to solve an existing challenge; once the benefits are confirmed and limitations are understood we would move to ADOPT. We typically move to TRIAL once we have ASSESSED.</li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth investing some research and investigation into to see if it has the desired impact. ASSESS technologies are new to us and are highly unproven in our organisation.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for our clients and internally at Instant Impact. Technologies that we have decided not to renew contractually or are not (yet for us) solving a specifically challenge or other reasons. It is our recommendation that HOLD technologies should not be used unless for specific projects and discussion with the Transformation Team.</li>
</ul>

We categorise the technologies into the following four quadrants: 

<ul>
<li><strong>TOOLS</strong> &mdash; A TOOL is a specialised software or application designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem four our clients or internal teams. It typically integrates with other systems but does not provide a full infrastructure on its own.  They are considered adds on to the existing platforms that we all used across most of our clients and internally.</li>
<li><strong>PLATFORMS</strong> &mdash; A PLATFORM is a comprehensive system or ecosystem that provides the infrastructure to build, deploy, or manage multiple processes. It often supports multiple tools and can function as a standalone solution to solve one or multiple problems.</li>
<li><strong>FRAMEWORKS</strong> &mdash; FRAMEWORKS or methodologies we have adopted as a business. They usually follow best practices and help us gain efficiencies in certain areas.  A framework is a structured method that provides guidelines, models, or criteria to help make decisions or complete tasks. It is often repeatable and provides a clear systematic approach to solving problems.
<li><strong>TECHNIQUES</strong> &mdash; A TECHNIQUE is a tactical method or approach used to achieve a goal or solve a problem. It is more flexible than a framework and does not necessarily follow a structured model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support the Transformation Team at Instant Impact to pick the best technologies for new projects and to solve some of our problems.  It provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are of interest to us a business— changes that we think our teams should pay attention to become an even more tech-enabled business. </p>

<h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Chief Transformation Officer</em> and <em>Product Manager</em> — who facilitate and drive the technology selection discussions at Instant Impact. Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Tech Radar is open for contribution for all Instant Impact team members at Instant Impact and depends on their active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>

<p>
In addition to the Tech Radar, we actively collaborate with existing tech partners to enhance their product offerings for our clients and internal teams. To see Instant Impact's roadmap, click here (TBC). </p>
