<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool that supports Instant Impact's Transformation Team globally by providing a platform to share knowledge and experience with our various technologies. This easy-to-read format makes tools easier to discover and helps us evaluate technologies thoroughly. This project is based on the This project is based on the Zalando/tech-radar.

The Instant Impact Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called *ring assignment*. We categorise technologies into four rings, defined as follows:
We categorise the technologies into the following four quadrants: 
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our Instant Impact production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support the Transformation Team at Instant Impact to pick the best technologies for new projects and to solve some of our problems.  It provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are of interest to us a business— changes that we think our teams should pay attention to become an even more tech-enabled business. </p>
</p>

<h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Chief Transformation Officer</em> and <em>Product Manager</em> — who facilitate and drive the technology selection discussions at Instant Impact. Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Tech Radar is open for contribution for all Instant Impact team members at Instant Impact and depends on their active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.</p>
</p>

<p>
In addition to the Tech Radar, we actively collaborate with existing tech partners to enhance their product offerings for our clients and internal teams. To see Instant Impact's roadmap, click here (TBC). </p>
